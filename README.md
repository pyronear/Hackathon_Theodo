# Theodo x PyroNear Fire Tinder Hackathon

Welcome to the PyroNear Fire Tinder Hackathon! This event is organized by Theodo to help PyroNear develop an innovative tool we're calling the "Tinder of Fire." The goal is to efficiently classify images to improve fire detection models.

## Overview

PyroNear receives numerous data points from various sources, including images that may contain fires or false positives (FP). Before annotating images with bounding boxes for training an object detection model, it is crucial to efficiently separate actual fire images from false positives.

To achieve this, we aim to develop a "Fire Tinder" tool. This tool will display a series of images from a single fire event, allowing users to swipe right if the series shows a fire or swipe left if it is a false positive. By quickly filtering out false positives, we can focus on annotating images that are most valuable for training, enhancing both speed and accuracy.

## Hackathon Challenge

During this hackathon, we will explore three different versions of the Fire Tinder:

1. **Mobile Version**: A mobile app that allows users to classify image series on the go.
2. **Web Version**: A web application that provides a convenient platform for classifying image series.
3. **No-Code Version**: A version that enables users to contribute without any coding experience, using drag-and-drop tools and pre-built templates.
