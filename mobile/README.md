# Welcome to the mobile app of the Pyronear Hackathon

## Running the app

1. Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

4. You can then open it on your mobile phone in the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) application.

## Building/Publishing the app

To build the app, the simplest way would be to use [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) and to follow their documentation.

It's free if you stay below 30 builds per month and you don't need to install Android Studio or XCode and their associated tooling on your PC.
